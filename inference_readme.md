Use this blueprint to immediately summarize English text to short sentences. To use this pretrained text-summarization model, create a ready-to-use API-endpoint that can be quickly integrated with your data and application.

This inference blueprint’s model was trained using the WikiLingua Multilingual Abstractive Summarization dataset. To use custom data according to your specific business, run this counterpart’s [training blueprint](https://metacloud.staging-cloud.cnvrg.io/marketplace/blueprints/text-summarization-train), which trains the model and establishes an endpoint based on the newly trained model.

Complete the following steps to deploy a text-summarization API endpoint:
1. Click the **Use Blueprint** button.
2. In the dialog, select the relevant compute to deploy the API endpoint and click the **Start** button.
3. The cnvrg software redirects to your endpoint. Complete one or both of the following options:
   - Use the Try it Live section with any text to check your model.
   - Use the bottom integration panel to integrate your API with your code by copying in the code snippet.

An API endpoint that summarizes English text has now been deployed. To learn how this blueprint was created, click [here](https://github.com/cnvrg/text-summarization).
