# Text Summarization (Endpoint)
You can use this blueprint to immediately summarize text or wikipedia articles For using this pretrained text summarization model, you will need to create a ready-to-use API-endpoint that can be integrated with your data and application, in minutes.

- Click on Use Blueprint button
- In the pop up, choose the relevant compute you want to use to deploy your API endpoint
- You will be redirected to your endpoint
- You can use the Try it Live section with any image to check your model
- You can also integrate your API with your code using the integration panel at the bottom of the page

Congrats! You have deployed an API endpoint that summarizes wikipedia articles and custom texts!
